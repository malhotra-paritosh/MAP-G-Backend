# MAP-G-Backend

## Mindset Analysis using Psychometric Games (Map-G)

MAP-G is originally developed as the Capstone Project for my Bachelors of Technology Degree at [Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh](https://pec.ac.in/) by the team of [Aanshi Bansal](https://github.com/AanshiBansal), [Paritosh Malhotra(me)](https://github.com/malhotra-paritosh), [Vaibhav Setia](https://github.com/vaibhav-setia), [Shreya Garg](https://github.com/shreyaagarg) and Navdeep Kaur

**M**indset **A**nalysis using **P**sychometric **G**ames (Map-G) is a framework developed with the objective of using Psychometric games to quantify,evaluate and analyze favourable traits for teachers/professors. 

This is in line with the Psychometric tests and platforms that tech and other companies have started to employ to get a psychometric analysis of their prospective candidates. It was envisioned as a research project across the domains of Computer Science, Psychology and Software Engineering, and has since grown to become a fully functioning framework.

### This repository contains the backend of the project, which has been developed by me. 
The backend is in Django with Django REST Framework working on top to provide RESTful API services. The Database used is PostgreSQL. Also used are OpenCV for report generation and SMTP for emailing the report to the user.
